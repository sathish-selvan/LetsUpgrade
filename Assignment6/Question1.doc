# Question 1
# A Barua number is a number that consists of only zeroes and ones and has only one 1. Baruaâ€™s
# number will start with 1. Given numbers, find out the multiplication of the numbers. Note: The
# input may contain one decimal number and all other Barua numbers. (Assume that each number
# is the very large and the total number of values give is also very large)

#sample test cases::
# Input 1: 100 10 12 1000
# Output 1: 12000000
# Input 2: 100 121 1000000000000000
# Output 2: 12100000000000000000
# Input 3: 10 100 1000
# Output 3: 1000000

#Answer:::

a = list(map(str,input().split(" ")))
counter = 0
decimal = 1
for i in a:
    if int(i) % 10 != 0:
        decimal = i
    else:
        counter += i.count("0")

print(str(decimal)+counter*"0")
